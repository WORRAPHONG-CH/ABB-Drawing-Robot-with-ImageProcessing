# ABB-Drawing-Robot-with-ImageProcessing
I was an intern at ABB AUTOMATION (THAILAND) CO.,LTD
- Role: Project Engineer (Internship)
- Project: Drawing Robot with Image Processing
- Responsibility: Developing a program to enable a robot to draw image based on user input.
## Concept
-   Applied image processing techniques to preprocess and obtained sketch image.
-   Applied TSP  (The Traveling Salesman Problem) algorithm to optimized path of drawing.
-   Calculate z-axis position and convert Python code to RAPID code in RobotStudio.
-   The RAPID code simulated in 3D to draw the image which capture from camera.
